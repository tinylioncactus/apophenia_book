<p>&quot;Well, I've come this far...big tech has always been my dream...I may as well find out if I am at their bar&quot; he tells Jeanine. &quot;Honey, you're good enough, whether an interview loop can spot it or not&quot; she comforts him with a smile. &quot;Can you be the next interviewer?&quot; Lucas proposes with a smirk, before pouring himself a glass of wine from the open bottle.</p>
<p>The next day Lucas sets up the final meeting for Friday afternoon. Again he will work from home in the afternoon. To Lucas' surprise, multiple members of his team have complimented how productive he has been in the afternoons he has spent working from home, and how he has appeared less stressed and more creative when he has been in the office. Of course Lucas knows there is more to his situation, but is glad his team is benefiting from his changes, and promises to himself to more frequently work from home even if the interviews do no lead to a new role.</p>
<p>The final interview - for company fit - is harder to prepare for in some ways. Lucas has read the mission statement and company principles on their website. He's heard these referenced in the many tech talks the company has on Youtube, and he saw first hand in the first two rounds how their engineers describe problems through these principles as a lens. Lucas is yet to drink the Koolaid from the bottle, but he certainly has a glass at the ready. Lucas used Wednesday and Thursday night to think through projects and situations at the companies he has worked at. The exact numbers describing the impact of his work - scale, money, time etc. - aren't fresh in his mind, but he can roughly remember the details enough to tell a meaningful story. After looking for examples of &quot;cultural fit&quot; questions online, he turns to ChatGpt to generate more sample questions for him to fit his work to. &quot;Are you going to have a break before the interview?&quot; Jeanine jokingly calls out from the bedroom. It's 11:30pm and Lucas concedes it is better that he has a solid nights rest than pretend this preparation is more than an attempt to distract from his nerves.</p>
<p>When Jeanine arrives home on Friday afternoon Lucas is no where to be found. &quot;Hello?&quot; she calls out. &quot;Lucas?&quot;. The only reply comes from the cat, who performs a long stretch worthy of a yoga class, and flops on the ground in front of Jeanine. &quot;What did you do with your spare human?&quot; she quizzes Sugar, expressing her curiosity of why Lucas isn't catching up on his work after the interview.</p>
<p>Lucas strolls back through the door a few minutes later and heads to his home office unaware that Jeanine is busy tending to the gardens in the backyard. An hour later when Lucas stops for a break, he notices Jeanine and heads out to greet her. Lucas explains how after the interview he took himself for a walk up the nearby hills to decompress and think through the interview loop he has now completed. &quot;Well you seem very relaxed. I bet you shone like a star and they'll be wanting you to start on Monday!&quot; Jeanine says in encouragement. &quot;I am happy with how I went&quot; he confirms, &quot;but I think it will take a few days for them to come back with a decision. I'm also still not one hundred percent certain this would be a good change&quot; he shares.</p>
<p>Across the weekend Lucas can't help but replay moments from the interviews in his head. While he's still happy with how he performed, there are several ways he would handle the interviewer's questions differently. He realises that he would not have this benefit if he had not continued with the loop, or if he never pursued it to begin with. If nothing else comes from it, it has been good practice for when he does want to move to a new company. He even considers making a habit of practicing leetcode questions to keep his interview skills sharp.</p>
<p>Later next week, Lucas is still waiting to hear the result of the interview loop. Although it is taking longer than he anticipated, he knows big companies move slower. He sits eating his lunch at the kitchen bench, distracting himself with a blog about developer productivity on Medium. Eventually his curiosity is overwhelming and he checks the job application status on the portal from his phone. There on the screen is the answer he has been looking for. How long has it been there? Why wasn't he called? His mind races.</p>
<p>Status: PASSED</p>
<p>&quot;Wooohoo!&quot; he announces to the empty dining room. &quot;But what now? What's next?&quot; the vague status leaves him wondering. Lucas thinks back to the original call with the recruiter - she didn't mention what to expect <em>after</em> the loop. He won't be waiting long this time - Miranda's name flashes on his phone screen. Lucas takes a deep breath and accepts the call.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi Lucas, I have Sheree from HR on the call as well. We have some news on your application that we'd like to share with you&quot; Miranda says. &quot;Hi Miranda, Hi Sheree. Yes I just saw on the portal that I passed the loop&quot; Lucas excitedly says. &quot;What's next?&quot; he asks.</p>
