<p>&quot;Well the team really enjoyed meeting you and we'd like to extend an offer to you&quot; Sheree explains. &quot;That's great!&quot; Lucas replies. Sheree details the offer; partly a base salary, partly a sign on bonus, and partly RSU's (company shares earned after a period of time). &quot;I'll send over the details this afternoon&quot; she tells Lucas. &quot;Thanks Sheree, I'll need a couple days to review. Let's chat later this week&quot; Lucas replies.</p>
<p>Lucas slumps in his chair - emotions mixed, his thoughts racing, and a churn in his stomach unrelated to his lunch. When the email from Sheree arrives Lucas sifts quickly through the important details. This is the moment Lucas has wanted since he first started studying technology at university. An offer from big tech; confirmation his years of hard work were well spent; and pride that he met the highest bar he could imagine.</p>
<p>Yet the moment is overshadowed by the details as Lucas dives further into the offer. Although he did share a range for compensation originally, and this offer did indeed meet that range (barely), it would only meet it for the first year. Without a signing bonus in the second year, Lucas would be earning less than he currently is. Was fulfilling his long held desire for big tech worth the reduction? Is it worth the title? His thoughts continued to race. What was the title? Suddenly Lucas noticed the title was also not what he knew of the role either. &quot;Software Engineer&quot; - a significant enough difference from &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot; to consolidate his thoughts at once.</p>
<p>The offer was generous for that level, but Lucas was certain he had interviewed for the senior role. He checked the online portal. The description of the role indeed still spoke of a senior role, however, the title had been updated to &quot;Software Engineer&quot;. &quot;Ah, the ol' bait and switch&quot; he thought. Disappointed and frustrated, Lucas resists the urge to reply to the email. He sets down his phone on the bench, liberated to be detached from the situation, and heads towards the door for a walk around the hills. Recognizing the onset of strong emotions and reactive thoughts is a hard fought strength and maturity Lucas is proud he has developed. His initial thoughts may be correct, but a moment like this could easily be turned into win with the right framing.</p>
<p>&quot;So what do you <em>want</em> to do?&quot; Jeanine asks after Lucas explains the situation later that night. &quot;All I can do now is find out more. What level is the role? Are the responsibilities what I expected for this level, and how do they compare to the Senior level.&quot; Lucas confidently states. &quot;Isn't it a bit deceptive?&quot; Jeanine asks. &quot;It feels a bit dishonest to have you interview for one role then change the goalposts afterwards&quot; she adds, empathizing with how she expects Lucas must be feeling. &quot;That's one way to look at it&quot; he replies calmly, &quot;but there is only one outcome that thinking like that can lead to, and less to be gained from it&quot;.</p>
<p>Jeanine's eyes are locked on Lucas, intrigued by his optimistic approach to the situation, and eagerly waiting for his next words. &quot;If long term I will grow more, have more opportunities, and more potential earning power...well a short term <em>easier</em> role would make sense&quot; Lucas suggests. &quot;That's...true. I didn't think about it like that&quot; Jeanine admits. Lucas continues, &quot;...and if what you suggest is true; if the actual team turns out to be as misleading as this interview situation...well I can always move to another team, or another company, and I'll be better off with this experience behind me...more than I will by staying with what I already have.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeanine continues nodding after Lucas finishes, her gaze unbroken as he moves around the kitchen preparing dinner for both of them. &quot;You know, I'm so proud of you Lucas. No matter what decision you make on this, you have already helped yourself fix your situation&quot; Jeanine tells him.</p>
<p>The next morning Lucas meets again with Sheree to go over the questions Lucas has. Most importantly, Lucas confirms the level is lower than his original expectations. Sheree explains &quot;The team really think you're a great fit and want you to join. When they met to discuss feedback, they felt you would be more successful coming in with lower expectations initially, and being on the fast path to promotion&quot;. &quot;I see&quot; Lucas says, &quot;so then I should expect still to do the job of a senior engineer to demonstrate readiness for promotion?&quot;. &quot;Yes - that will be your fast path to promotion&quot; Sheree explains. &quot;I see&quot; Lucas responds, not letting on how this affects his decision.</p>
<p>&quot;So, how does the offer sound...are you ready to become a Bluey?&quot; Sheree playfully asks, referring to the self assigned nickname given to the company's engineers. &quot;Well...&quot; Lucas begins &quot;based on what I know about the role I would be happy to come over if we can top up the RSU allocation to 300&quot;. Sheree's response is delayed. Lucas is confident this is beyond her authority to agree to and is not surprised when he is told she will need to discuss with her team. Lucas thanks her for their conversation and reiterates his readiness to &quot;become a Bluey&quot; before ending the call. &quot;Woo...FIGJAM!&quot; Lucas' exclaims aloud, his fist punching the air and startling Sugar into evacuating the room. A wave of pride rushes over Lucas as Jeanine's words from last night run through his head.</p>
<p>Lucas slides the rocker on his phone to take it off silent. A rare occurrence, but justified in these equally rare circumstances. The anticipation of the phone ringing distracts Lucas through the afternoon as he waits to hear whether his counter offer will be accepted. He finds himself checking the screen multiple times; he has so infrequently heard his phone ring he isn't entirely sure which ringtone is set and whether he would notice if it rang.</p>
<p>The phone does not ring that afternoon however. Nor does it ring the next morning.</p>
<p>Lucas heads to the office to distract himself from the anticipation of Sheree's response. He avoids his phone, keeping the rocker firmly on silent and checking only at lunch when Jeanine usually sends a message. That afternoon as Lucas reviews pull requests from his team he notices an immersive sense of serenity in his work. He leaves encouraging notes of appreciation for the junior engineers on their reviews, and later sends each a &quot;big note&quot; (the company tool for peer recognition) to highlight their growth to those outside his team. As he heads home for the day he reflects on how the interview experience has given him a fresh look at his work and his team. His own growth has led to positive guidance for them and more appreciation for Lucas a leader. </p>
<p>Lucas checks his personal email after breakfast the next morning. Through the newsletters and unwanted emails he finds the reply he has been waiting for. A fresh reply on the original offer email. Lucas quickly opens and reads the brief single line of text:</p>
