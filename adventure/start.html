<p>&quot;ugggggh&quot; Lucas groans, as he scrambles once more for his phone on the nightstand. He grabs at the charging cable and the phone crashes to the hardwood floor, making even more noise, and ensuring his wife is definitely also now awake. Her exasperated heavy sigh removes any doubt. Lucas swipes at the screen three times until the funk-jazz ringtone finally stops, leaving only the bright glare of blue light screaming 4:38 am. The ringtone was supposed to make it slightly less painful when he is paged, but after hearing it for the third time since midnight, it has definitely lost any of the mild humour it once had.</p>
<p>&quot;What...now...&quot; he complains to himself; fumbling through the familiar sequence of two-factor security checks, feature-crippled corporate browser navigation, and in-house ticketing system to get to any indication of what so desperately needs his attention. It's now 4:40. and the last shred of optimism for an issue that can be resolved from the comfort of bed is gone. One foot, then the next reluctantly hits the floor and he trudges towards the spare room where his company laptop awaits. &quot;No..it's not playtime now Sugar&quot; he whispers in the general direction of the house cat; who has turned its initial confusion at the change of routine into eager readiness for playtime, an early feeding, or anything other than what must be done in the spare room.</p>
<p>The sun has already started its daily ascent, slowly illuminating the dining room and the makeshift home office with a warm glow that signals his chance of returning to sleep is quickly vanishing. There was a time when Lucas would be walking these floor boards towards the back door on his way for morning exercise. Some mornings it was a bike ride along the local river; sometimes a brisk walk to the peak of the nearby hill that overlooks the parks that surround the city. Usually only a podcast kept him company, though sometimes his wife Jeanine would join him. Those walks together were a distant memory now as the monthly occurence of a week of night time paging ensured the three other &quot;off weeks&quot; were critical for recovery and preservation.</p>
<p>The glare of the operating system logo prys both eyes wide open while his laptop loads. The downgraded ticket from a little over an hour ago when he was last awake refreshes on one screen. &quot;Pending upgrade&quot; it flashes, indicating he has a little over two hours until the pager is guaranteed to fire again when &quot;business hours&quot; resume. Right now though he has to keep his attention on the latest issue, which has finally loaded the full details on his second screen. &quot;Cannot delete old items from the portal&quot; reads the title. The ticket details explain a chaotic cry for urgent help from 'Liddy'. &quot;Well that explains the 18 unread Slack notifications&quot; Lucas mumbles, simultaneously loading the service dashboard and acknowledging he's investigating the ticket. When the dashboard does eventually load, he's greeted by an array of graphs measuring every detail of the service. He skims through disk usage, CPU utilization, inode usage, canary success rates, p99.99 latency measurements and API call volumes. The graphs have been a labour of love for Lucas and his team over the last few months since they took ownership of the service. Each graph has clear indications of the alarm level relevant to the graph, direct links to relevant runbooks, and an annotated history of significant and recent events they have seen. The graphs share one other important factor - they all indicate perfect health.</p>
<p>&quot;What the...&quot; he groans, in a mixture of disbelief, fear of an issue he has no metrics for, and the resignation that he's no closer to resting. &quot;Hi Liddy - can you please describe the business impact, the steps you have taken to resolve, and provide details of the items you unsuccessfully attempted to delete, thanks! Lucas&quot; he posts to the ticket, before switching over to the Slack window while he awaits a reply. Intuition has served him well again - the 18 notifications are all from Liddy, starting at 3:56 and ending a few minutes before the dulcet Jazz tones dragged him back into his semi-conscious early morning state. The first few messages are cheery; a warm good morning and friendly how-do-you-do without an indication of the urgency of the ticket. A stranger would assume Liddy and Lucas are long time friends, but they have certainly never met. The next message - 8 minutes later is not so pleasant. In fact this one way conversation peaked before 4am, and by 4:30 had devolved into a different number of question marks once a minute.</p>
<p>Each of Lucas' three screens has open an issue he has worked on during the night. On the right most screen is the ticket opened by Liddy; the window flashes due to an update and draws Lucas' attention. The reply makes little sense to him - it talks of products sold on the external website, while Lucas builds and maintains internal tools and services for other software teams - some that are indeed found via an internal portal. As he re-reads the ticket description, the pieces of the puzzle fall in to place - Liddy has opened the ticket to the wrong team. Tomorrow - or rather, later today - Lucas will find a new ticket group was created with a name close enough to his own that has caused the confusion. He updates the ticket and re-routes it to the correct group before noticing that the queue of 10 open tickets from yesterday has grown to 35 in the last hour. The fix is quick and the misplaced tickets are moved to their rightful owners. As the clock ticks past 5am he happily closes the lid of his laptop. The CPU fans spin to a stop - no longer needing to cool the hardware struggling to keep up with the browser full of abandonded tabs.</p>
<p>Lucas' head rests momentarily on the laptop - partly from exhaustion, and partly as a physical prevention for it to interrupt his morning again. &quot;Dammit...&quot; he sighs as he remembers the other issue that will escalate in less than two hours. Lucas thinks for a moment. &quot;No, screw it&quot; he defiantly declares to the room, shuffling slowly over to the old couch at the back of the house before collapsing on its worn out springs. The couch is the furthermost place from the bedroom Jeanine is (hopefully) asleep in, so the inevitable 7am paging will surely not wake her. No need then for the regular 6:30 morning alarm either he realizes, quickly disabling it so he can soak up an extra 30 minutes sleep. &quot;At least I will be off-call in two days&quot; he thinks to himself, as he places a throw cushion over his weary eyes and waits for sleep or exhaustion to render him unconscious.</p>
<p>It feels like five minutes has past when the Jazz tune rings out from between the couch cushions, growing increasingly louder like an impatient hungry child. Sugar scrambles as finally the pager is silenced. 9:12am. &quot;9:12! What happened to the 7am wake up page? Where is Jeanine? How can four hours have passed already?!&quot; Lucas wonders. His head is pounding as if he had enjoyed one too many beers last night; the heat of the sun compounding the pain, and adding to the nausea of sleep deprivation. There are no details of the issue on the paging notification, again. This time there doesn't need to be though - Lucas can see it comes from his new boss - Dean.</p>
<p>Lucas heads to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, knowing it may be a while before he can leave his seat once he gets started on the latest issue. &quot;What's up boss?&quot; he pings to Dean. No reply. Lucas waits, keeping himself busy with reading the titles of new tickets that have arrived since 5am. To his surprise, the ticket he expected to wake him is no where to be seen. Still no response from Dean. The forest green dot next to his name indicates he is online, but he must be preocupied. Lucas waits another minute before getting up to turn on the coffee machine. A good shot of caffeine will surely help shake the haze from the morning. The air fills with the smell of freshly ground beans, but that is as close to becoming a cup of coffee as they will get. Midway through the grind the reply from Dean arrived on Lucas' phone, and he rushed back to the spare room to reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Where were you!?&quot; the first message ironically reads. &quot;You were supposed to present our metrics at the Ops review meeting at 9&quot;. A wave of defeat rolls over Lucas, different from the times his pager broke his sleep, but equally crushing of his spirit. The Ops review is a weekly meeting to review operational health. The review is attended by senior managers and lead engineers from across the company and gives engineers a spotlight to shine on improvements the team has made and to seek advice or help where services need improving. Lucas' skip manager had volun-told Lucas he needed to present for twenty minutes today late in the afternoon yesterday. Lucas knew exactly what he wanted to present and was looking forward to the opportunity. In that moment he also knew exactly what missing the meeting meant.</p>
<p>&quot;I slept through my alarm...&quot; he types, before pausing, and deleting the words. &quot;I'm wiped out from three pages last night and missed the call&quot; he reluctantly replies. &quot;Is there any time left to present?&quot; he questions. The reply is delayed again. Lucas waits, starring motionless at the screen, his stomach churning from missing breakfast and the ominous feeling of missing the review. &quot;No, Swami took care of it, wrapping up now, chat later&quot; comes the reply. A mix of relief for his team, and loss for the personal opportunity fills the rest of the morning. By late afternoon the pager has finally managed a full hour of silence, so Lucas decides to sign off for a few hours.</p>
<p>Several days later Lucas and Dean are both working from the office and decide to take a walk to a nearby coffee shop while they hold their regular 1:1. Dean is new to the team, however he has been with the company for almost as long as Lucas, and they have agreed on the direction of the team in most conversations to date. Dean is a polite character with a skill for listening to problems rather than jumping to solutions. The clanging of mugs and background chatter in the popular coffee shop force them to talk louder than they would otherwise. Dean makes small chat and they both avoid talking about the business around the other coffee addicts awaiting their fix. When the coffee order arrives they head across the road to a bench over looking the dog park.</p>
<p>&quot;What's on your mind?&quot; asks Dean. &quot;Oncall...the ops review I missed...&quot; Lucas says, screwing his face up and assuming Dean is watching the goofy Labrador playing with a tired old rope. Lucas briefly wonders if his face bears some resemblance to the rope after the last week.</p>
<p>&quot;...and what else?&quot; Dean probes. &quot;promo&quot; Lucas reluctantly sighs. The dogs continue to bark and a cyclist zips past close to the bench, cutting the silence that had started to form after Lucas' reply. &quot;Well, which is the biggest challenge?&quot; Dean asks. &quot;Well, they're all somewhat related, I think&quot; Lucas quips. &quot;The Ops review was important...for the team and for me. I know Marni asked me to present it for a reason, and I know she still doesn't trust our team yet&quot;. &quot;True, on both accounts&quot; Dean confirms.</p>
<p>Lucas pauses, slightly shocked at how quickly Dean's response came. &quot;I have been putting in everything I can to get our operations under control, to get all the new hires ramped up, and to get the design for the new platform ready...but there just aren't enough hours in the day to make it all happen&quot; he explains in a mix of frustration and mild desperation. &quot;That's correct&quot; Dean confidently says, eyes still fixated on the Labrador across the road. &quot;So, how can I help?&quot; he asks.</p>
