<p>&quot;ugggggh&quot; Lucas groans, as he scrambles once more for his phone on the nightstand. He grabs at the charging cable and the phone crashes to the hardwood floor, making even more noise, and ensuring his wife is definitely also now awake. Her exasperated heavy sigh removes any doubt. Lucas swipes at the screen three times until the funk-jazz ringtone finally stops, leaving only the bright glare of blue light screaming 4:38 am. The ringtone was supposed to make it slightly less painful when he is paged, but after hearing it for the third time since midnight, it has definitely lost any of the mild humour it once had.</p>
<p>&quot;What...now...&quot; he complains to himself; fumbling through the familiar sequence of two-factor security checks, feature-crippled corporate browser navigation, and in-house ticketing system to get to any indication of what so desperately needs his attention. It's now 4:40. and the last shred of optimism for an issue that can be resolved from the comfort of bed is gone. One foot, then the next reluctantly hits the floor and he trudges towards the spare room where his company laptop awaits. &quot;No..it's not playtime now Sugar&quot; he whispers in the general direction of the house cat; who has turned its initial confusion at the change of routine into eager readiness for playtime, an early feeding, or anything other than what must be done in the spare room.</p>
<p>The sun has already started its daily ascent, slowly illuminating the dining room and the makeshift home office with a warm glow that signals his chance of returning to sleep is quickly vanishing. There was a time when Lucas would be walking these floor boards towards the back door on his way for morning exercise. Some mornings it was a bike ride along the local river; sometimes a brisk walk to the peak of the nearby hill that overlooks the parks that surround the city. Usually only a podcast kept him company, though sometimes his wife Jeanine would join him. Those walks together were a distant memory now as the monthly occurence of a week of night time paging ensured the three other &quot;off weeks&quot; were critical for recovery and preservation.</p>
<p>The glare of the operating system logo prys both eyes wide open while his laptop loads. The downgraded ticket from a little over an hour ago when he was last awake refreshes on one screen. &quot;Pending upgrade&quot; it flashes, indicating he has a little over two hours until the pager is guaranteed to fire again when &quot;business hours&quot; resume. Right now though he has to keep his attention on the latest issue, which has finally loaded the full details on his second screen. &quot;Cannot delete old items from the portal&quot; reads the title. The ticket details explain a chaotic cry for urgent help from 'Liddy'. &quot;Well that explains the 18 unread Slack notifications&quot; Lucas mumbles, simultaneously loading the service dashboard and acknowledging he's investigating the ticket. When the dashboard does eventually load, he's greeted by an array of graphs measuring every detail of the service. He skims through disk usage, CPU utilization, inode usage, canary success rates, p99.99 latency measurements and API call volumes. The graphs have been a labour of love for Lucas and his team over the last few months since they took ownership of the service. Each graph has clear indications of the alarm level relevant to the graph, direct links to relevant runbooks, and an annotated history of significant and recent events they have seen. The graphs share one other important factor - they all indicate perfect health.</p>
<p>&quot;What the...&quot; he groans, in a mixture of disbelief, fear of an issue he has no metrics for, and the resignation that he's no closer to resting. &quot;Hi Liddy - can you please describe the business impact, the steps you have taken to resolve, and provide details of the items you unsuccessfully attempted to delete, thanks! Lucas&quot; he posts to the ticket, before switching over to the Slack window while he awaits a reply. Intuition has served him well again - the 18 notifications are all from Liddy, starting at 3:56 and ending a few minutes before the dulcet Jazz tones dragged him back into his semi-conscious early morning state. The first few messages are cheery; a warm good morning and friendly how-do-you-do without an indication of the urgency of the ticket. A stranger would assume Liddy and Lucas are long time friends, but they have certainly never met. The next message - 8 minutes later is not so pleasant. In fact this one way conversation peaked before 4am, and by 4:30 had devolved into a different number of question marks once a minute.</p>
<p>Each of Lucas' three screens has open an issue he has worked on during the night. On the right most screen is the ticket opened by Liddy; the window flashes due to an update and draws Lucas' attention. The reply makes little sense to him - it talks of products sold on the external website, while Lucas builds and maintains internal tools and services for other software teams - some that are indeed found via an internal portal. As he re-reads the ticket description, the pieces of the puzzle fall in to place - Liddy has opened the ticket to the wrong team. Tomorrow - or rather, later today - Lucas will find a new ticket group was created with a name close enough to his own that has caused the confusion. He updates the ticket and re-routes it to the correct group before noticing that the queue of 10 open tickets from yesterday has grown to 35 in the last hour. The fix is quick and the misplaced tickets are moved to their rightful owners. As the clock ticks past 5am he happily closes the lid of his laptop. The CPU fans spin to a stop - no longer needing to cool the hardware struggling to keep up with the browser full of abandonded tabs.</p>
<p>Lucas' head rests momentarily on the laptop - partly from exhaustion, and partly as a physical prevention for it to interrupt his morning again. &quot;Dammit...&quot; he sighs as he remembers the other issue that will escalate in less than two hours. Lucas thinks for a moment. &quot;No, screw it&quot; he defiantly declares to the room, shuffling slowly over to the old couch at the back of the house before collapsing on its worn out springs. The couch is the furthermost place from the bedroom Jeanine is (hopefully) asleep in, so the inevitable 7am paging will surely not wake her. No need then for the regular 6:30 morning alarm either he realizes, quickly disabling it so he can soak up an extra 30 minutes sleep. &quot;At least I will be off-call in two days&quot; he thinks to himself, as he places a throw cushion over his weary eyes and waits for sleep or exhaustion to render him unconscious.</p>
<p>It feels like five minutes has past when the Jazz tune rings out from between the couch cushions, growing increasingly louder like an impatient hungry child. Sugar scrambles as finally the pager is silenced. 9:12am. &quot;9:12! What happened to the 7am wake up page? Where is Jeanine? How can four hours have passed already?!&quot; Lucas wonders. His head is pounding as if he had enjoyed one too many beers last night; the heat of the sun compounding the pain, and adding to the nausea of sleep deprivation. There are no details of the issue on the paging notification, again. This time there doesn't need to be though - Lucas can see it comes from his new boss - Dean.</p>
<p>Lucas heads to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, knowing it may be a while before he can leave his seat once he gets started on the latest issue. &quot;What's up boss?&quot; he pings to Dean. No reply. Lucas waits, keeping himself busy with reading the titles of new tickets that have arrived since 5am. To his surprise, the ticket he expected to wake him is no where to be seen. Still no response from Dean. The forest green dot next to his name indicates he is online, but he must be preocupied. Lucas waits another minute before getting up to turn on the coffee machine. A good shot of caffeine will surely help shake the haze from the morning. The air fills with the smell of freshly ground beans, but that is as close to becoming a cup of coffee as they will get. Midway through the grind the reply from Dean arrived on Lucas' phone, and he rushed back to the spare room to reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Where were you!?&quot; the first message ironically reads. &quot;You were supposed to present our metrics at the Ops review meeting at 9&quot;. A wave of defeat rolls over Lucas, different from the times his pager broke his sleep, but equally crushing of his spirit. The Ops review is a weekly meeting to review operational health. The review is attended by senior managers and lead engineers from across the company and gives engineers a spotlight to shine on improvements the team has made and to seek advice or help where services need improving. Lucas' skip manager had volun-told Lucas he needed to present for twenty minutes today late in the afternoon yesterday. Lucas knew exactly what he wanted to present and was looking forward to the opportunity. In that moment he also knew exactly what missing the meeting meant.</p>
<p>&quot;I slept through my alarm...&quot; he types, before pausing, and deleting the words. &quot;I'm wiped out from three pages last night and missed the call&quot; he reluctantly replies. &quot;Is there any time left to present?&quot; he questions. The reply is delayed again. Lucas waits, starring motionless at the screen, his stomach churning from missing breakfast and the ominous feeling of missing the review. &quot;No, Swami took care of it, wrapping up now, chat later&quot; comes the reply. A mix of relief for his team, and loss for the personal opportunity fills the rest of the morning. By late afternoon the pager has finally managed a full hour of silence, so Lucas decides to sign off for a few hours.</p>
<p>Several days later Lucas and Dean are both working from the office and decide to take a walk to a nearby coffee shop while they hold their regular 1:1. Dean is new to the team, however he has been with the company for almost as long as Lucas, and they have agreed on the direction of the team in most conversations to date. Dean is a polite character with a skill for listening to problems rather than jumping to solutions. The clanging of mugs and background chatter in the popular coffee shop force them to talk louder than they would otherwise. Dean makes small chat and they both avoid talking about the business around the other coffee addicts awaiting their fix. When the coffee order arrives they head across the road to a bench over looking the dog park.</p>
<p>&quot;What's on your mind?&quot; asks Dean. &quot;Oncall...the ops review I missed...&quot; Lucas says, screwing his face up and assuming Dean is watching the goofy Labrador playing with a tired old rope. Lucas briefly wonders if his face bears some resemblance to the rope after the last week.</p>
<p>&quot;...and what else?&quot; Dean probes. &quot;promo&quot; Lucas reluctantly sighs. The dogs continue to bark and a cyclist zips past close to the bench, cutting the silence that had started to form after Lucas' reply. &quot;Well, which is the biggest challenge?&quot; Dean asks. &quot;Well, they're all somewhat related, I think&quot; Lucas quips. &quot;The Ops review was important...for the team and for me. I know Marni asked me to present it for a reason, and I know she still doesn't trust our team yet&quot;. &quot;True, on both accounts&quot; Dean confirms.</p>
<p>Lucas pauses, slightly shocked at how quickly Dean's response came. &quot;I have been putting in everything I can to get our operations under control, to get all the new hires ramped up, and to get the design for the new platform ready...but there just aren't enough hours in the day to make it all happen&quot; he explains in a mix of frustration and mild desperation. &quot;That's correct&quot; Dean confidently says, eyes still fixated on the Labrador across the road. &quot;So, how can I help?&quot; he asks.</p>

</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="burnt-out"><a class="header" href="#burnt-out">Burnt. Out.</a></h1>
<p>&quot;I...I...I think...I don't know..&quot; Lucas sheepishly replies. A moment passes as the competing priorities racing through his mind become an intertwined soup of ideas, frustrations, and micro-needs all seemingly unworthy of diving into at this moment. Dean continues staring ahead, focused on the dogs across the road chasing a well weathered red ball thrown by one of the owners. Lucas - blinded by his own racing mind, undoubtedly now jet-fueled by caffeine - is abnormally lost for words. The right words at least; for this moment.</p>
<p>Lucas is well known for thinking through endless permutations of scenarios and putting in place back-up plans to back-up plans. His words carry more weight with his team than he ever takes the time to acknowledge or notice, and he appears to always have the answer ready for the next question that will be asked. Countless times this has made him invaluable to managers seeking quick answers, and to other engineers struggling through painful operational events. Lucas is sure there is nothing unique about this ability; it is the result of relentless hard work to grow, improve, and be prepared for the unknown. Lately he has noticed however, that the payoff for the time spent being 'two steps ahead' is diminishing, and the more he learns, the slower he has become to respond with action when it is needed.</p>
<p>&quot;gahh...Hicks law&quot; Lucas mutters as he shakes his head in disappointment at his inability to string together a coherent and actionable response for Dean. Dean turns his head and looks puzzeldly at Lucas. &quot;What's a Hickslaw?&quot; Dean asks, genuinely curious at what he has misheard. &quot;No, no. Hicks. Law. Loosely, the more choices you have, the longer it takes to choose&quot; Lucas rushes to inform Dean. &quot;Right&quot; Dean quickly replies, nodding as he realizes what Lucas said. &quot;but isn't it also true that the more often you are faced with the same choices, your response becomes faster?&quot; Dean continues. &quot;ah...yeah...yeah that's also true&quot; Lucas adds, realizing yet again Dean may be guiding Lucas towards an outcome beyond his blindspot. A silence forms again, broken this time by Dean when he continues &quot;...so if that's true, then, applying it to what's in your head right now, could it also be true that you're so busy thinking through so many different decisions that you're not focusing enough on the smaller set that really impacts you?&quot;</p>
<p>Lost for words, in a different way now, Lucas sighs and slumps a little on the bench. His mind seamlessly switched from Dean's original ask, to processing this far more challenging question. Am I being too shallow in my assessments? Is Dean giving subtle feedback on my performance? What does <em>really</em> impact me? Lucas' mind again begins melting into a soup of over analysis and inaction. &quot;So, how can I help?&quot; Dean says, interrupting the silent swirl of Lucas' mind before it goes too far again.</p>
<p>&quot;I...I think I need some time to think about that&quot; Lucas cautiously tells Dean. &quot;Great, I can help with that...why don't you take a week off and see where you're at after that, or if you need more time&quot; Dean offers. &quot;That sounds great, but I am saving my holidays for later this year - Jeanine and I are going on our first skiing trip together - so I can't use up my vacation now&quot; Lucas explains. &quot;This won't be vacation time Lucas&quot; Dean informs, &quot;...you need to take sick leave&quot;.</p>
<p>Lucas tingles with a wave of shock, confusion, and concern for his career. Lucas rarely takes sick days and his annual vacation balance usually only shrinks every few years when Jeanine suggests one big trip. At the start of his career, Lucas saved his vacation hours to cash-in at a higher salary level when he changed companies. Since he has stayed at the same company for a few years now his salary is roughly the same, he hasn't had the payout, and nor has he taken the rest that regular vacations offer. Working at a company with an &quot;unlimited vacation&quot; policy, it turned out, really only normalized over-working among the over-achieving types the job attracted. Dean's offer, nay instruction, was a stark constrast to how Lucas thought of time off.</p>
<p>&quot;You're going to need to trust me on this Lucas. I know it isn't a decision you would consider, much less make, so think of this as a growth opportunity to try learn a different way to operate&quot; Dean says as he stands to stretch and head back to the office. &quot;Yes, okay, I can try this&quot; Lucas replies, rising to his feet as well. &quot;Great, I heard a yes...so then you know what I'm going to ask next right?&quot; Dean prompts. &quot;Right...'yes to this, then no to what else?'&quot; Lucas recites, showing he realizes the familiar formula Dean uses for their 1:1's. &quot;Right&quot; Dean smirks.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if I'm going to be away for a week...then..everything?&quot; Lucas half heartedly says. &quot;Try again&quot; Dean sternly responds, his tone an abrupt contrast to the previous empathetic instruction to take leave. Realizing the naievity of his initial response, Lucas scrambles &quot;well I can ask whoever is next oncall to pick-up the tasks I assigned to myself after my oncall shift last week&quot;. &quot;Right...what else?&quot; Dean prompts. &quot;Well...I can ask Li to start on-boarding the last new hire that starts on Monday&quot;. &quot;Right...what else?&quot; Dean challenges Lucas again, knowing Lucas' plate is still far from empty. Lucas takes advantage of the break in conversation that the noise of a passing truck provides to consider his options, however he knows there is only one right answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I need someone to finish the design for the two notification services by the end of next week to keep our deadline&quot; Lucas admits, realizing how perpostorous it would have been to have tried to finalise these after a week out of the office. &quot;I will ask Li to pick those up&quot;. &quot;...ask Michael to take one, Li the other. You choose which&quot; Dean instructs as they round the final corner to the office. Lucas can't hold back his surprise and asks &quot;two engineers? Isn't that overkill?&quot;. &quot;Why? Two designs is two engineers work&quot; Dean tells him. &quot;Just because <em>you</em> have been doing both, and more, doesn't make it less&quot;.</p>
<p>Lucas, not fully convinvced by what Dean has told him, reserves his words as they badge back in to the office and head to the elevator bay. &quot;So...what was...&quot; Dean begins &quot;...most useful?&quot; Lucas interrupts, finishing Dean's sentence. &quot;Well...all of it. But if I have to be specific..&quot; Lucas pauses. &quot;You do&quot;, Dean half interrupts, with a smirk. The elevator door opens, two levels below their own for another employee to exit. &quot;Well?&quot; he asks, as he steps out, leaving Lucas alone in the elevator, aware that the closing doors will force a response without the overthinking. &quot;You helped me see that...I'm burnt out&quot;. The door closes and Lucas ascends to the level his desk is on. He shuffles towards his desk, with the words of his realization echoing in his mind. &quot;I'm not burning out, I'm burnt out&quot; he reiterates to himself.</p>
<p>Come 5pm, Lucas has met with Li and Michael and excitedly told them about the opportunity they have to design these new services. In the near distance he can hear their conversation abuzz with excitement from being asked to own parts of the design that they have until now only curiously watched Lucas put together. Lucas also finds time to delegate the followup operational tasks to Swami; who adds her own suggestions based on what she learned from presenting at the Ops review meeting in Lucas' absence.</p>
<p>Lucas closes the lid on his laptop and heads for the door. A sense of guilt at dropping more work on his team clouds his initial feeling of relief for the coming days away from the office. Back at home, he makes his way through the house dropping off his jacket and keys, and Jeanine excitedly welcomes the news that he is taking time off. &quot;That's a really smart idea; you need it, you have been like a zombie for weeks now&quot; she confides. Lucas is only somewhat shocked at her words. &quot;It's been really tough for both of us, so I'm so happy that you're doing something about it finally&quot; she adds, grabbing him in a smothering hug before he has time to drop his laptop bag. He knows it hasn't been easy for either of them, but this is the first time he has truly acknowledged the impact his choices have had on Jeanine too. Her embrace is somehow different tonight.</p>
<p>The next morning Lucas awakes, alone in bed. He taps the smooth face of his smartwatch to check the time. Momentarily forgetting that he won't be heading to work on this rainy Friday morning, his heart races to see it is 11am! Lucas had not slept past 6:30 on a weekday since his time at university. He calms and heads to the kitchen where a note on the counter from Jeanine let's him know he is both loved, and alone for the next six hours. &quot;I'll just quickly check email and see if Li needs any help with that design&quot; he thinks, pulling out his laptop, and sipping a morning coffee while it boots. His efforts come to a halt when he discovers he cannot log in - his account has been locked out. He has no access to email, Slack, the annoying corporate browser, or in fact any connection to what is going on inside the company. His stomach sinks and his mind immediately races for answers, from extreme thoughts of being locked out for misuing sick days, to concerns his account has been compromised somehow. He grabs for his phone to message Dean to find out why, only to find there is a message waiting for him.</p>
<p>The message from four hours ago reads &quot;I have asked IT to suspend your account, just so you aren't tempted to check in ;) Enjoy the rest and come back when you know you're ready&quot;. Dean is a step ahead again. The message calms Lucas for now; and he instead begins to reflect on why he was so quick to jump to extreme explanations for the lockout. He notices how he also had immediately started forming options for how to regain access once he realised he was locked out. Frustrated at his own reactions, he attempts to drown the thoughts of work in the coffee as he knows he should, but his mind keeps finding a way to bring him back to it each time he focuses on something new.</p>
<p>Why were the extreme scenarios so quick to be acted on, but the more probable and less extreme options not pursued first? Had he learned to respond to extreme options first because of their potential impact, because of how often they were the root cause, or because of the mental reward that comes from solving more extreme scenarios? &quot;Only a cowboy shoots first and asks questions later&quot; he lectures himself. Had he become the cowboy engineer he so despised without realising? If so, when, and why? Each question lead to another, filling any momentary quiet and escape from the sense of urgency to find an answer. Day one of sick leave and he was already able to see a blindspot, one that must be so obvious to everyone else around him. Lucas' mind continued to replay scenarios from the last few months, trying to remember what he had considered at the time, and the actions he had taken. Again and again he saw the pattern: shoot first, ask questions later. Why was he handling so many situations this way? In hindsight, what could he have done differently? It was too soon to understand how or why he had become trained to think and act this way, but he knew he didn't want it to continue.</p>
<p>Years earlier, Lucas had mentored a quiet intern at the start of the intern's career. The intern carried with them a pocketsize star wars themed notebook, distinctly separate and seemingly redundant from their laptop. On almost every occassion Lucas met with the intern in person the notebook would gain a half page of handwritten notes. At the end of the internship, Lucas's curiosity finally got the better of him and he asked what the notebook was for. Considering the intern also took notes, scrawled drawings, and added photos directly to organized notes on their laptop, the notebook seemed to be an unecessary burden to carry around. &quot;I use this to capture what I'm feeling, what I can't process about a situation in the moment, and what I need to understand later. The notebook is for me, not the company&quot; the intern taught him. At the time Lucas thought this idea was clever, but it never seemed to solve a problem he could see, so it never become a habit. Like many good habits, times were too good then to see the need for the habit. Now as he sat staring into an empty coffee cup, he realized this habit was exactly what he wanted to discover why he responded to situations the way he does, and how he might be able to change these responses to get a different outcome.</p>
<p>Lucas pushes his cup across the bench towards the sink. He picks himself up from the stool he had been perched on at the kitchen bar and heads to the cabinet in the spare room to find his own version of the star wars notebook. The best he can rustle up is a corporate notebook abandoned after his new hire induction years before. &quot;Good enough...I can always add stickers I guess&quot; he tells the empty room. Sugar waits in the hallway peering through the door, ever curious at the opening of a door. </p>
<p>Back at the kitchen bench Lucas begins writing about the rough night from earlier in the week. After a slow start, he begins writing down what he felt during the times he was paged. Frustration; from being impacted by careless decisions of others. Exhaustion; from sleep deprevation and guilt from inflicting it on Jeanine as well. Hopelessness; despite implementing so many technical improvements the operational load was only marginally better than months earlier. Shame; that he missed his opportunity at the ops review meeting, is falling behind on his more important goals for the year, and by pushing through it all, his manager needed to force an involuntary stop.</p>
<p>&quot;ugggggh&quot; Lucas groans, realizing this isn't the first, or last time he will face these feelings unless he makes more changes. Ding. His phone informs of the arrival of a fresh email. &quot;I should turn these off&quot; he tells himself, but the title catches his eye and he finds himself reading further before he has time to act on that thought.</p>
