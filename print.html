<p>&quot;ugggggh&quot; Lucas groans, as he scrambles once more for his phone on the nightstand. He grabs at the charging cable and the phone crashes to the hardwood floor, making even more noise, and ensuring his wife is definitely also now awake. Her exasperated heavy sigh removes any doubt. Lucas swipes at the screen three times until the funk-jazz ringtone finally stops, leaving only the bright glare of blue light screaming 4:38 am. The ringtone was supposed to make it slightly less painful when he is paged, but after hearing it for the third time since midnight, it has definitely lost any of the mild humour it once had.</p>
<p>&quot;What...now...&quot; he complains to himself; fumbling through the familiar sequence of two-factor security checks, feature-crippled corporate browser navigation, and in-house ticketing system to get to any indication of what so desperately needs his attention. It's now 4:40. and the last shred of optimism for an issue that can be resolved from the comfort of bed is gone. One foot, then the next reluctantly hits the floor and he trudges towards the spare room where his company laptop awaits. &quot;No..it's not playtime now Sugar&quot; he whispers in the general direction of the house cat; who has turned its initial confusion at the change of routine into eager readiness for playtime, an early feeding, or anything other than what must be done in the spare room.</p>
<p>The sun has already started its daily ascent, slowly illuminating the dining room and the makeshift home office with a warm glow that signals his chance of returning to sleep is quickly vanishing. There was a time when Lucas would be walking these floor boards towards the back door on his way for morning exercise. Some mornings it was a bike ride along the local river; sometimes a brisk walk to the peak of the nearby hill that overlooks the parks that surround the city. Usually only a podcast kept him company, though sometimes his wife Jeanine would join him. Those walks together were a distant memory now as the monthly occurence of a week of night time paging ensured the three other &quot;off weeks&quot; were critical for recovery and preservation.</p>
<p>The glare of the operating system logo prys both eyes wide open while his laptop loads. The downgraded ticket from a little over an hour ago when he was last awake refreshes on one screen. &quot;Pending upgrade&quot; it flashes, indicating he has a little over two hours until the pager is guaranteed to fire again when &quot;business hours&quot; resume. Right now though he has to keep his attention on the latest issue, which has finally loaded the full details on his second screen. &quot;Cannot delete old items from the portal&quot; reads the title. The ticket details explain a chaotic cry for urgent help from 'Liddy'. &quot;Well that explains the 18 unread Slack notifications&quot; Lucas mumbles, simultaneously loading the service dashboard and acknowledging he's investigating the ticket. When the dashboard does eventually load, he's greeted by an array of graphs measuring every detail of the service. He skims through disk usage, CPU utilization, inode usage, canary success rates, p99.99 latency measurements and API call volumes. The graphs have been a labour of love for Lucas and his team over the last few months since they took ownership of the service. Each graph has clear indications of the alarm level relevant to the graph, direct links to relevant runbooks, and an annotated history of significant and recent events they have seen. The graphs share one other important factor - they all indicate perfect health.</p>
<p>&quot;What the...&quot; he groans, in a mixture of disbelief, fear of an issue he has no metrics for, and the resignation that he's no closer to resting. &quot;Hi Liddy - can you please describe the business impact, the steps you have taken to resolve, and provide details of the items you unsuccessfully attempted to delete, thanks! Lucas&quot; he posts to the ticket, before switching over to the Slack window while he awaits a reply. Intuition has served him well again - the 18 notifications are all from Liddy, starting at 3:56 and ending a few minutes before the dulcet Jazz tones dragged him back into his semi-conscious early morning state. The first few messages are cheery; a warm good morning and friendly how-do-you-do without an indication of the urgency of the ticket. A stranger would assume Liddy and Lucas are long time friends, but they have certainly never met. The next message - 8 minutes later is not so pleasant. In fact this one way conversation peaked before 4am, and by 4:30 had devolved into a different number of question marks once a minute.</p>
<p>Each of Lucas' three screens has open an issue he has worked on during the night. On the right most screen is the ticket opened by Liddy; the window flashes due to an update and draws Lucas' attention. The reply makes little sense to him - it talks of products sold on the external website, while Lucas builds and maintains internal tools and services for other software teams - some that are indeed found via an internal portal. As he re-reads the ticket description, the pieces of the puzzle fall in to place - Liddy has opened the ticket to the wrong team. Tomorrow - or rather, later today - Lucas will find a new ticket group was created with a name close enough to his own that has caused the confusion. He updates the ticket and re-routes it to the correct group before noticing that the queue of 10 open tickets from yesterday has grown to 35 in the last hour. The fix is quick and the misplaced tickets are moved to their rightful owners. As the clock ticks past 5am he happily closes the lid of his laptop. The CPU fans spin to a stop - no longer needing to cool the hardware struggling to keep up with the browser full of abandonded tabs.</p>
<p>Lucas' head rests momentarily on the laptop - partly from exhaustion, and partly as a physical prevention for it to interrupt his morning again. &quot;Dammit...&quot; he sighs as he remembers the other issue that will escalate in less than two hours. Lucas thinks for a moment. &quot;No, screw it&quot; he defiantly declares to the room, shuffling slowly over to the old couch at the back of the house before collapsing on its worn out springs. The couch is the furthermost place from the bedroom Jeanine is (hopefully) asleep in, so the inevitable 7am paging will surely not wake her. No need then for the regular 6:30 morning alarm either he realizes, quickly disabling it so he can soak up an extra 30 minutes sleep. &quot;At least I will be off-call in two days&quot; he thinks to himself, as he places a throw cushion over his weary eyes and waits for sleep or exhaustion to render him unconscious.</p>
<p>It feels like five minutes has past when the Jazz tune rings out from between the couch cushions, growing increasingly louder like an impatient hungry child. Sugar scrambles as finally the pager is silenced. 9:12am. &quot;9:12! What happened to the 7am wake up page? Where is Jeanine? How can four hours have passed already?!&quot; Lucas wonders. His head is pounding as if he had enjoyed one too many beers last night; the heat of the sun compounding the pain, and adding to the nausea of sleep deprivation. There are no details of the issue on the paging notification, again. This time there doesn't need to be though - Lucas can see it comes from his new boss - Dean.</p>
<p>Lucas heads to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, knowing it may be a while before he can leave his seat once he gets started on the latest issue. &quot;What's up boss?&quot; he pings to Dean. No reply. Lucas waits, keeping himself busy with reading the titles of new tickets that have arrived since 5am. To his surprise, the ticket he expected to wake him is no where to be seen. Still no response from Dean. The forest green dot next to his name indicates he is online, but he must be preocupied. Lucas waits another minute before getting up to turn on the coffee machine. A good shot of caffeine will surely help shake the haze from the morning. The air fills with the smell of freshly ground beans, but that is as close to becoming a cup of coffee as they will get. Midway through the grind the reply from Dean arrived on Lucas' phone, and he rushed back to the spare room to reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Where were you!?&quot; the first message ironically reads. &quot;You were supposed to present our metrics at the Ops review meeting at 9&quot;. A wave of defeat rolls over Lucas, different from the times his pager broke his sleep, but equally crushing of his spirit. The Ops review is a weekly meeting to review operational health. The review is attended by senior managers and lead engineers from across the company and gives engineers a spotlight to shine on improvements the team has made and to seek advice or help where services need improving. Lucas' skip manager had volun-told Lucas he needed to present for twenty minutes today late in the afternoon yesterday. Lucas knew exactly what he wanted to present and was looking forward to the opportunity. In that moment he also knew exactly what missing the meeting meant.</p>
<p>&quot;I slept through my alarm...&quot; he types, before pausing, and deleting the words. &quot;I'm wiped out from three pages last night and missed the call&quot; he reluctantly replies. &quot;Is there any time left to present?&quot; he questions. The reply is delayed again. Lucas waits, starring motionless at the screen, his stomach churning from missing breakfast and the ominous feeling of missing the review. &quot;No, Swami took care of it, wrapping up now, chat later&quot; comes the reply. A mix of relief for his team, and loss for the personal opportunity fills the rest of the morning. By late afternoon the pager has finally managed a full hour of silence, so Lucas decides to sign off for a few hours.</p>
<p>Several days later Lucas and Dean are both working from the office and decide to take a walk to a nearby coffee shop while they hold their regular 1:1. Dean is new to the team, however he has been with the company for almost as long as Lucas, and they have agreed on the direction of the team in most conversations to date. Dean is a polite character with a skill for listening to problems rather than jumping to solutions. The clanging of mugs and background chatter in the popular coffee shop force them to talk louder than they would otherwise. Dean makes small chat and they both avoid talking about the business around the other coffee addicts awaiting their fix. When the coffee order arrives they head across the road to a bench over looking the dog park.</p>
<p>&quot;What's on your mind?&quot; asks Dean. &quot;Oncall...the ops review I missed...&quot; Lucas says, screwing his face up and assuming Dean is watching the goofy Labrador playing with a tired old rope. Lucas briefly wonders if his face bears some resemblance to the rope after the last week.</p>
<p>&quot;...and what else?&quot; Dean probes. &quot;promo&quot; Lucas reluctantly sighs. The dogs continue to bark and a cyclist zips past close to the bench, cutting the silence that had started to form after Lucas' reply. &quot;Well, which is the biggest challenge?&quot; Dean asks. &quot;Well, they're all somewhat related, I think&quot; Lucas quips. &quot;The Ops review was important...for the team and for me. I know Marni asked me to present it for a reason, and I know she still doesn't trust our team yet&quot;. &quot;True, on both accounts&quot; Dean confirms.</p>
<p>Lucas pauses, slightly shocked at how quickly Dean's response came. &quot;I have been putting in everything I can to get our operations under control, to get all the new hires ramped up, and to get the design for the new platform ready...but there just aren't enough hours in the day to make it all happen&quot; he explains in a mix of frustration and mild desperation. &quot;That's correct&quot; Dean confidently says, eyes still fixated on the Labrador across the road. &quot;So, how can I help?&quot; he asks.</p>

<p>&quot;I...I...I think...I don't know..&quot; Lucas sheepishly replies. A moment passes as the competing priorities racing through his mind become an intertwined soup of ideas, frustrations, and micro-needs all seemingly unworthy of diving into at this moment. Dean continues staring ahead, focused on the dogs across the road chasing a well weathered red ball thrown by one of the owners. Lucas - blinded by his own racing mind, undoubtedly now jet-fueled by caffeine - is abnormally lost for words. The right words at least; for this moment.</p>
<p>Lucas is well known for thinking through endless permutations of scenarios and putting in place back-up plans to back-up plans. His words carry more weight with his team than he ever takes the time to acknowledge or notice, and he appears to always have the answer ready for the next question that will be asked. Countless times this has made him invaluable to managers seeking quick answers, and to other engineers struggling through painful operational events. Lucas is sure there is nothing unique about this ability; it is the result of relentless hard work to grow, improve, and be prepared for the unknown. Lately he has noticed however, that the payoff for the time spent being 'two steps ahead' is diminishing, and the more he learns, the slower he has become to respond with action when it is needed.</p>
<p>&quot;gahh...Hicks law&quot; Lucas mutters as he shakes his head in disappointment at his inability to string together a coherent and actionable response for Dean. Dean turns his head and looks puzzeldly at Lucas. &quot;What's a Hickslaw?&quot; Dean asks, genuinely curious at what he has misheard. &quot;No, no. Hicks. Law. Loosely, the more choices you have, the longer it takes to choose&quot; Lucas rushes to inform Dean. &quot;Right&quot; Dean quickly replies, nodding as he realizes what Lucas said. &quot;but isn't it also true that the more often you are faced with the same choices, your response becomes faster?&quot; Dean continues. &quot;ah...yeah...yeah that's also true&quot; Lucas adds, realizing yet again Dean may be guiding Lucas towards an outcome beyond his blindspot. A silence forms again, broken this time by Dean when he continues &quot;...so if that's true, then, applying it to what's in your head right now, could it also be true that you're so busy thinking through so many different decisions that you're not focusing enough on the smaller set that really impacts you?&quot;</p>
<p>Lost for words, in a different way now, Lucas sighs and slumps a little on the bench. His mind seamlessly switched from Dean's original ask, to processing this far more challenging question. Am I being too shallow in my assessments? Is Dean giving subtle feedback on my performance? What does <em>really</em> impact me? Lucas' mind again begins melting into a soup of over analysis and inaction. &quot;So, how can I help?&quot; Dean says, interrupting the silent swirl of Lucas' mind before it goes too far again.</p>
<p>&quot;I...I think I need some time to think about that&quot; Lucas cautiously tells Dean. &quot;Great, I can help with that...why don't you take a week off and see where you're at after that, or if you need more time&quot; Dean offers. &quot;That sounds great, but I am saving my holidays for later this year - Jeanine and I are going on our first skiing trip together - so I can't use up my vacation now&quot; Lucas explains. &quot;This won't be vacation time Lucas&quot; Dean informs, &quot;...you need to take sick leave&quot;.</p>
<p>Lucas tingles with a wave of shock, confusion, and concern for his career. Lucas rarely takes sick days and his annual vacation balance usually only shrinks every few years when Jeanine suggests one big trip. At the start of his career, Lucas saved his vacation hours to cash-in at a higher salary level when he changed companies. Since he has stayed at the same company for a few years now his salary is roughly the same, he hasn't had the payout, and nor has he taken the rest that regular vacations offer. Working at a company with an &quot;unlimited vacation&quot; policy, it turned out, really only normalized over-working among the over-achieving types the job attracted. Dean's offer, nay instruction, was a stark contrast to how Lucas thought of time off.</p>
<p>&quot;You're going to need to trust me on this Lucas. I know it isn't a decision you would consider, much less make, so think of this as a growth opportunity to try learn a different way to operate&quot; Dean says as he stands to stretch and head back to the office. &quot;Yes, okay, I can try this&quot; Lucas replies, rising to his feet as well. &quot;Great, I heard a yes...so then you know what I'm going to ask next right?&quot; Dean prompts. &quot;Right...'yes to this, then no to what else?'&quot; Lucas recites, showing he realizes the familiar formula Dean uses for their 1:1's. &quot;Right&quot; Dean smirks.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if I'm going to be away for a week...then..everything?&quot; Lucas half heartedly says. &quot;Try again&quot; Dean sternly responds, his tone an abrupt contrast to the previous empathetic instruction to take leave. Realizing the naivety of his initial response, Lucas scrambles &quot;well I can ask whoever is next oncall to pick-up the tasks I assigned to myself after my oncall shift last week&quot;. &quot;Right...what else?&quot; Dean prompts. &quot;Well...I can ask Li to start on-boarding the last new hire that starts on Monday&quot;. &quot;Right...what else?&quot; Dean challenges Lucas again, knowing Lucas' plate is still far from empty. Lucas takes advantage of the break in conversation that the noise of a passing truck provides to consider his options, however he knows there is only one right answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I need someone to finish the design for the two notification services by the end of next week to keep our deadline&quot; Lucas admits, realizing how preposterous it would have been to have tried to finalize these after a week out of the office. &quot;I will ask Li to pick those up&quot;. &quot;...ask Michael to take one, Li the other. You choose which&quot; Dean instructs as they round the final corner to the office. Lucas can't hold back his surprise and asks &quot;two engineers? Isn't that overkill?&quot;. &quot;Why? Two designs is two engineers work&quot; Dean tells him. &quot;Just because <em>you</em> have been doing both, and more, doesn't make it less&quot;.</p>
<p>Lucas, not fully convinced by what Dean has told him, reserves his words as they badge back in to the office and head to the elevator bay. &quot;So...what was...&quot; Dean begins &quot;...most useful?&quot; Lucas interrupts, finishing Dean's sentence. &quot;Well...all of it. But if I have to be specific..&quot; Lucas pauses. &quot;You do&quot;, Dean half interrupts, with a smirk. The elevator door opens, two levels below their own for another employee to exit. &quot;Well?&quot; he asks, as he steps out, leaving Lucas alone in the elevator, aware that the closing doors will force a response without the overthinking. &quot;You helped me see that...I'm burnt out&quot;. The door closes and Lucas ascends to the level his desk is on. He shuffles towards his desk, with the words of his realization echoing in his mind. &quot;I'm not burning out, I'm burnt out&quot; he reiterates to himself.</p>
<p>Come 5pm, Lucas has met with Li and Michael and excitedly told them about the opportunity they have to design these new services. In the near distance he can hear their conversation abuzz with excitement from being asked to own parts of the design that they have until now only curiously watched Lucas put together. Lucas also finds time to delegate the followup operational tasks to Swami; who adds her own suggestions based on what she learned from presenting at the Ops review meeting in Lucas' absence.</p>
<p>Lucas closes the lid on his laptop and heads for the door. A sense of guilt at dropping more work on his team clouds his initial feeling of relief for the coming days away from the office. Back at home, he makes his way through the house dropping off his jacket and keys, and Jeanine excitedly welcomes the news that he is taking time off. &quot;That's a really smart idea; you need it, you have been like a zombie for weeks now&quot; she confides. Lucas is only somewhat shocked at her words. &quot;It's been really tough for both of us...I'm so happy that you're finally doing something about it&quot; she adds, grabbing him in a smothering hug before he has time to drop his laptop bag. He knows it hasn't been easy for either of them, but this is the first time he has truly acknowledged the impact his choices have had on Jeanine too. Her embrace is somehow different tonight.</p>
<p>The next morning Lucas awakes, alone in bed. He taps the smooth face of his smartwatch to check the time. Momentarily forgetting that he won't be heading to work on this rainy Friday morning, his heart races to see it is 11am! Lucas had not slept past 6:30 on a weekday since his time at university. He calms and heads to the kitchen where a note on the counter from Jeanine let's him know he is both loved, and alone for the next six hours. &quot;I'll just quickly check email and see if Li needs any help with that design&quot; he thinks, pulling out his laptop, and sipping a morning coffee while it boots. His efforts come to a halt when he discovers he cannot log in - his account has been locked out. He has no access to email, Slack, the annoying corporate browser, or in fact any connection to what is going on inside the company. His stomach sinks and his mind immediately races for answers, from extreme thoughts of being locked out for misusing sick days, to concerns his account has been compromised somehow. He grabs for his phone to message Dean to find out why, only to find there is a message waiting for him.</p>
<p>The message from four hours ago reads &quot;I have asked IT to suspend your account, just so you aren't tempted to check in ;) Enjoy the rest and come back when you know you're ready&quot;. Dean is a step ahead again. The message calms Lucas for now; and he instead begins to reflect on why he was so quick to jump to extreme explanations for the lockout. He notices how he also had immediately started forming options for how to regain access once he realised he was locked out. Frustrated at his own reactions, he attempts to drown the thoughts of work in the coffee as he knows he should, but his mind keeps finding a way to bring him back to it each time he focuses on something new.</p>
<p>Why were the extreme scenarios so quick to be acted on, but the more probable and less extreme options not pursued first? Had he learned to respond to extreme options first because of their potential impact, because of how often they were the root cause, or because of the mental reward that comes from solving more extreme scenarios? &quot;Only a cowboy shoots first and asks questions later&quot; he lectures himself. Had he become the cowboy engineer he so despised without realising? If so, when, and why? Each question lead to another, filling any momentary quiet and escape from the sense of urgency to find an answer. Day one of sick leave and he was already able to see a blindspot, one that must be so obvious to everyone else around him. Lucas' mind continued to replay scenarios from the last few months, trying to remember what he had considered at the time, and the actions he had taken. Again and again he saw the pattern: shoot first, ask questions later. Why was he handling so many situations this way? In hindsight, what could he have done differently? It was too soon to understand how or why he had become trained to think and act this way, but he knew he didn't want it to continue.</p>
<p>Years earlier, Lucas had mentored a quiet intern at the start of the intern's career. The intern carried with them a pocketsize star wars themed notebook, distinctly separate and seemingly redundant from their laptop. On almost every occasion Lucas met with the intern in person the notebook would gain a half page of handwritten notes. At the end of the internship, Lucas's curiosity finally got the better of him and he asked what the notebook was for. Considering the intern also took notes, scrawled drawings, and added photos directly to organized notes on their laptop, the notebook seemed to be an unnecessary burden to carry around. &quot;I use this to capture what I'm feeling, what I can't process about a situation in the moment, and what I need to understand later. The notebook is for me, not the company&quot; the intern taught him. At the time Lucas thought this idea was clever, but it never seemed to solve a problem he could see, so it never become a habit. Like many good habits, times were too good then to see the need for the habit. Now as he sat staring into an empty coffee cup, he realized this habit was exactly what he needed to find out why he responded to situations the way he does, and how he might be able to change these responses to get a different outcome.</p>
<p>Lucas pushes his cup across the bench towards the sink. He picks himself up from the stool he had been perched on at the kitchen bar and heads to the cabinet in the spare room to find his own version of the star wars notebook. The best he can rustle up is a corporate notebook abandoned after his new hire induction years before. &quot;Good enough...I can always add stickers I guess&quot; he tells the empty room. Sugar waits in the hallway peering through the door, ever curious at the opening of a door. </p>
<p>Back at the kitchen bench Lucas begins writing about the rough night from earlier in the week. After a slow start, he begins writing down what he felt during the times he was paged. Frustration; from being impacted by careless decisions of others. Exhaustion; from sleep deprivation and guilt from inflicting it on Jeanine as well. Hopelessness; despite implementing so many technical improvements the operational load was only marginally better than months earlier. Shame; that he missed his opportunity at the ops review meeting, is now falling behind on his more important goals for the year, and by pushing through it all, his manager needed to force an involuntary stop.</p>
<p>&quot;ugggggh&quot; Lucas groans, realizing this isn't the first, or last time he will face these feelings unless he makes more changes. Ding. His phone informs of the arrival of a fresh email. &quot;I should turn these off&quot; he tells himself, but before he has time to act on that thought the title of the email catches his eye.</p>
<p>What is in the email?</p>

<p>&quot;Hi Lucas. I'm very impressed with your profile and would like to talk to you about an exciting new opportunity at Bluetech&quot;. Lucas eyes light up and he's immediately aware his heart beat has increased. Lucas deeply admires Bluetech. Frequently they had been sponsors of the tech conferences he has wanted to attend (if only he could convince the business to let him). Lucas has read so many of their engineering blogs and listened to hours of their recorded conference sessions. Bluetech might not have existed when he was a schoolboy, but his career dream has always been to work for a tech industry leader - and they certainly tick that box.</p>
<p>&quot;If you'd like to take the next step, please reserve a spot in my shared calendar using the link below. I look forward to meeting you! Best, Miranda&quot; the brief email concludes. Lucas previews the link to be sure this it isn't a scam. Satisfied the email is legitimate, he follows the link to book a spot with the recruiter without hesitation. To his excitement, there are even times available today! Not wanting to be unprepared however, he settles on a slot in the following afternoon.</p>
<p>The rest of the day does not turn out as he might have imagined, though considering there were no goals for the day to begin with, he has no complaints. The afternoon is spent scrolling through the marketing heavy Bluetech website, reading engineering blogs, comparing companies on levels.fyi, and writing down questions for the conversation. Classic Lucas; over-prepared. It is only when Jeanine arrives back mid-afternoon that the research ends and the kitchen clock catches up to reality.</p>
<p>When the time comes for the chat with the recruiter the next day, Lucas excitedly joins the Zoom call five minutes early. Miranda is not as punctual, but when she does her enthusiasm rivals that of Lucas. She describes the role and how her team had found his profile while looking through the contacts of existing engineers. Lucas had heard of other teams at his company being enticed to share their LinkedIn contacts over a <em>free</em> pizza lunch in the office. Seems like it was more common than he realised.</p>
<p>After listening to Lucas give a brief summary of his career, Miranda asks for salary expectations. Lucas knew not to share what he is already earning yet, and instead shares the modest range he determined from the afternoon of research the day before. A moment of nerves hits Lucas - talking financial arrangements is not his strong suit and he doesn't want to lose this opportunity over salary expectations. Miranda - evidently more experienced at these conversations - assures him the range is very achievable and goes on to detail the interview process. &quot;First you will need to pass a coding exam - a few simple questions you can do as a take home exam. It will only take a couple of hours&quot; she informs. &quot;Ok, that seems reasonable&quot; Lucas agrees.</p>
<p>&quot;If you pass, then your first round will be two one hour coding interviews with two of the senior engineers&quot; Miranda pauses. &quot;Ok...&quot; Lucas agrees while making notes in his notebook. &quot;Then the second round will be two more interviews; a system design meeting and a team values interview...&quot; she says before adding &quot;And the third round will be a company fit meeting with a bar raiser from another part of the business&quot;. Lucas waits to be sure there isn't a fourth round to be detailed. &quot;Ok...sounds fairly normal&quot; he replies. &quot;Yes very normal and you will have plenty of time to ask questions to each of your interviewers, so come prepared with all your questions for them&quot; she explains, seemingly wanting to divert from engaging in Q&amp;A right now. &quot;I'll send you a link to apply for this role and the link for the online coding exam after this call. How does that sound Lucas?&quot; Miranda asks, again signalling her eagerness for the call to end. &quot;That sounds fine&quot; he replies and the call ends in a final optimistically polite exchange. </p>
<p>Later that afternoon, Lucas tells Jeanine about the call as she unpacks her bag on the kitchen counter. &quot;A coding exam and five interviews?&quot; she asks with a slightly shocked tone in her voice. &quot;Yeah...it's quite a bit isn't it? It's normal though at these big companies&quot; he explains, trying not to sound as if he is defending a process he is not fully comfortable with himself. &quot;I've wanted to work at a place like this for a long time though...the kind of problems their engineers solve is rare to find anywhere else&quot; he adds; with excitement for the opportunity clear in his voice. It is not lost on Jeanine, though she continues to unpack while carrying on with the conversation.  &quot;Well...good...I'm sure you'll do great, and I'm happy if you're doing what makes you excited about your career again&quot; she says supportively. &quot;Thanks Jeany&quot; Lucas says through a thick smile.</p>
<p>At university Lucas aced his Data Structures and Algorithms courses, but it has been many years and multiple professional jobs since he graduated. The need to invert a binary tree or implement Dijkstra's algorithm had strangely never presented itself in his professional career. Later that evening, Lucas sits alone in their living room after Jeanine has gone to bed early. Not wanting to be too rusty for the interview loop, he signs up to leetcode.com to get in a few practice questions before he will attempt the coding exam tomorrow. The coding challenges surprise him initially - it takes a certain mindset and a lot less rust to answer these. In fact Lucas instead spends the next few nights solving challenges to build back his confidence for handling the textbook style riddles. It is Saturday afternoon before Lucas locks himself in his home office and attempts the Bluetech coding exam. The exam is easier than he has built it up to be in his mind, but requires the full two hours as promised by Miranda. A few days later he and Miranda are exchanging emails to arrange times for the first round of interviews. Lucas feels relieved to be past the first hurdle, and his decision to freshen up on leetcode questions was validated.</p>
<p>&quot;Monday afternoon for both works fine&quot; Lucas confirms to Miranda's suggestion for the first round. Fine is an exaggeration - Lucas knows he will need to extend his leave from work, albeit by a day. Though he feels a cringe of guilt for deceiving his team, he knows there will never be a convenient time for his current employer for Lucas to build his career beyond what they can offer. On Monday night, after nailing both interviews, Lucas again feels validated for choosing to invest in his development. Jeanine patiently listens to his enthusiastic retelling of the questions he was asked - though most of it is as confusing to her to decipher as a mechanic detailing the parts needed to fix a squeaky wheel. &quot;That's great!&quot; she exclaims, &quot;So when will you take the next round?&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd take them now if I could!&quot; Lucas confidently proclaims, &quot;but I'll have to arrange more time off&quot; he says with a sigh. &quot;Why the frown? Jeanine asks. &quot;Well I just had a week off, and now an extra day...if I take another day off so soon, don't you think it will start to raise questions as work?&quot; he says, baring his fear and guilt to Jeanine. &quot;Well...do you have to take a day off? Can you just work from home one afternoon?&quot; she proposes. &quot;Yes! That's a great idea...I can just work an hour later to make it up...good one Jeany!&quot; he says with the excitement again smeared across his face. Jeanine flashes an encouraging smile and disappears into the back of the house.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, after round two, Lucas' enthusiasm is more subdued. &quot;The values meeting was fine - I could talk about a lot of situations that the interviewer asked about.&quot; he tells Jeanine. &quot;So why the long face Mr Ed? Did you bomb the other one...what was it...interface design?&quot; she asks, her intentional misstatement aimed at brightening Lucas outlook. &quot;System Design&quot; Lucas replies disapprovingly yet playful, tilting his head and slightly rolling his eyes at Jeanine's joke. Jeanine pokes her tongue out at Lucas then takes a sip of her wine.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't my best work...but I did eventually solve the problem&quot; he says. &quot;So...you're not happy it wasn't perfect?&quot; Jeanine enquires. &quot;It was enough...but at the end of the interview, when I asked a few questions...the role sounded a bit different than what the recruiter described to me&quot; he tells. &quot;Oh...&quot; Jeanine pauses, &quot;In what way? What did you ask?&quot;. &quot;Well, I asked about how much time is spent between coding, support work, meetings; how many interviews they give each week...the usual stuff, you know.&quot; he pauses, then adds &quot;...well their oncall is a 12 hour shift, 4 days in a week, including weekends, once a month&quot;. Jeanines eyebrows raise as she waits to hear more.</p>
<p>&quot;Three or four interviews a week on average. Textbook scrum...so not a lot of meetings, just a lot of ceremonies&quot; he quips. &quot;What's the difference?&quot; Jeanine legitimately asks. &quot;Not much if you aren't building anything&quot; Lucas says. &quot;Righhhht...four interviews a week? You said there are thousands of engineers at this company...&quot; Jeanine starts, before Lucas interrupts to add &quot;More than one hundred thousand&quot;. Jeanine continues, &quot;...right, so if every engineer is giving four interviews a week...how have they not hired half the planet?&quot; she quizzes. &quot;Yeah, exactly. Either only a few meet their bar, or only a few want to keep working there&quot; Lucas replies, his eyes lowering as he ponders alternative explanations.</p>
<p>Jeanine takes another sip of her wine as the two sit side by side at the kitchen bench and share a moment of silent reflection. Eventually Jeanine breaks the silence to ask Lucas what he intends to do.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="adventure//adventure/recruiter_op_1_their_bar.html">Continue with the interview loop - may as well find out whether he meets the bar</a></li>
<li><a href="adventure//adventure/recruiter_op_1_im_out.html">Decline to continue - trust instincts, do it 100% or not at all</a></li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="their-bar"><a class="header" href="#their-bar">Their bar</a></h1>
<p>&quot;Well, I've come this far...big tech has always been my dream...I may as well find out if I am at their bar&quot; he tells Jeanine. &quot;Honey, you're good enough, whether an interview loop can spot it or not&quot; she comforts him with a smile. &quot;Can you be the next interviewer?&quot; Lucas proposes with a smirk, before pouring himself a glass of wine from the open bottle.</p>
<p>The next day Lucas sets up the final meeting for Friday afternoon. Again he will work from home in the afternoon. To Lucas' surprise, multiple members of his team have complimented how productive he has been in the afternoons he has spent working from home, and how he has appeared less stressed and more creative when he has been in the office. Of course Lucas knows there is more to his situation, but is glad his team is benefiting from his changes, and promises to himself to more frequently work from home even if the interviews do no lead to a new role.</p>
<p>The final interview - for company fit - is harder to prepare for in some ways. Lucas has read the mission statement and company principles on their website. He's heard these referenced in the many tech talks the company has on Youtube, and he saw first hand in the first two rounds how their engineers describe problems through these principles as a lens. Lucas is yet to drink the Koolaid from the bottle, but he certainly has a glass at the ready. Lucas used Wednesday and Thursday night to think through projects and situations at the companies he has worked at. The exact numbers describing the impact of his work - scale, money, time etc. - aren't fresh in his mind, but he can roughly remember the details enough to tell a meaningful story. After looking for examples of &quot;cultural fit&quot; questions online, he turns to ChatGpt to generate more sample questions for him to fit his work to. &quot;Are you going to have a break before the interview?&quot; Jeanine jokingly calls out from the bedroom. It's 11:30pm and Lucas concedes it is better that he has a solid nights rest than pretend this preparation is more than an attempt to distract from his nerves.</p>
<p>When Jeanine arrives home on Friday afternoon Lucas is no where to be found. &quot;Hello?&quot; she calls out. &quot;Lucas?&quot;. The only reply comes from the cat, who performs a long stretch worthy of a yoga class, and flops on the ground in front of Jeanine. &quot;What did you do with your spare human?&quot; she quizzes Sugar, expressing her curiosity of why Lucas isn't catching up on his work after the interview.</p>
<p>Lucas strolls back through the door a few minutes later and heads to his home office unaware that Jeanine is busy tending to the gardens in the backyard. An hour later when Lucas stops for a break, he notices Jeanine and heads out to greet her. Lucas explains how after the interview he took himself for a walk up the nearby hills to decompress and think through the interview loop he has now completed. &quot;Well you seem very relaxed. I bet you shone like a star and they'll be wanting you to start on Monday!&quot; Jeanine says in encouragement. &quot;I am happy with how I went&quot; he confirms, &quot;but I think it will take a few days for them to come back with a decision. I'm also still not one hundred percent certain this would be a good change&quot; he shares.</p>
<p>Across the weekend Lucas can't help but replay moments from the interviews in his head. While he's still happy with how he performed, there are several ways he would handle the interviewer's questions differently. He realises that he would not have this benefit if he had not continued with the loop, or if he never pursued it to begin with. If nothing else comes from it, it has been good practice for when he does want to move to a new company. He even considers making a habit of practicing leetcode questions to keep his interview skills sharp.</p>
<p>Later next week, Lucas is still waiting to hear the result of the interview loop. Although it is taking longer than he anticipated, he knows big companies move slower. He sits eating his lunch at the kitchen bench, distracting himself with a blog about developer productivity on Medium. Eventually his curiosity is overwhelming and he checks the job application status on the portal from his phone. There on the screen is the answer he has been looking for. How long has it been there? Why wasn't he called? His mind races.</p>
<p>Status: PASSED</p>
<p>&quot;Wooohoo!&quot; he announces to the empty dining room. &quot;But what now? What's next?&quot; the vague status leaves him wondering. Lucas thinks back to the original call with the recruiter - she didn't mention what to expect <em>after</em> the loop. He won't be waiting long this time - Miranda's name flashes on his phone screen. Lucas takes a deep breath and accepts the call.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi Lucas, I have Sheree from HR on the call as well. We have some news on your application that we'd like to share with you&quot; Miranda says. &quot;Hi Miranda, Hi Sheree. Yes I just saw on the portal that I passed the loop&quot; Lucas excitedly says. &quot;What's next?&quot; he asks.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="adventure//adventure/recruiter_op_1_a_yes_of_sorts.html">Miranda has an offer to share</a></li>
<li><a href="adventure//adventure/recruiter_op_1_a_no_of_sorts.html">Miranda has unexpected news</a></li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="a-yes-of-sorts"><a class="header" href="#a-yes-of-sorts">A yes, of sorts</a></h1>
<p>&quot;Well the team really enjoyed meeting you and we'd like to extend an offer to you&quot; Sheree explains. &quot;That's great!&quot; Lucas replies. Sheree details the offer; partly a base salary, partly a sign on bonus, and partly RSU's (company shares earned after a period of time). &quot;I'll send over the details this afternoon&quot; she tells Lucas. &quot;Thanks Sheree, I'll need a couple days to review. Let's chat later this week&quot; Lucas replies.</p>
<p>Lucas slumps in his chair - emotions mixed, his thoughts racing, and a churn in his stomach unrelated to his lunch. When the email from Sheree arrives Lucas sifts quickly through the important details. This is the moment Lucas has wanted since he first started studying technology at university. An offer from big tech; confirmation his years of hard work were well spent; and pride that he met the highest bar he could imagine.</p>
<p>Yet the moment is overshadowed by the details as Lucas dives further into the offer. Although he did share a range for compensation originally, and this offer did indeed meet that range (barely), it would only meet it for the first year. Without a signing bonus in the second year, Lucas would be earning less than he currently is. Was fulfilling his long held desire for big tech worth the reduction? Is it worth the title? His thoughts continued to race. What was the title? Suddenly Lucas noticed the title was also not what he knew of the role either. &quot;Software Engineer&quot; - a significant enough difference from &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot; to consolidate his thoughts at once.</p>
<p>The offer was generous for that level, but Lucas was certain he had interviewed for the senior role. He checked the online portal. The description of the role indeed still spoke of a senior role, however, the title had been updated to &quot;Software Engineer&quot;. &quot;Ah, the ol' bait and switch&quot; he thought. Disappointed and frustrated, Lucas resists the urge to reply to the email. He sets down his phone on the bench, liberated to be detached from the situation, and heads towards the door for a walk around the hills. Recognizing the onset of strong emotions and reactive thoughts is a hard fought strength and maturity Lucas is proud he has developed. His initial thoughts may be correct, but a moment like this could easily be turned into win with the right framing.</p>
<p>&quot;So what do you <em>want</em> to do?&quot; Jeanine asks after Lucas explains the situation later that night. &quot;All I can do now is find out more. What level is the role? Are the responsibilities what I expected for this level, and how do they compare to the Senior level.&quot; Lucas confidently states. &quot;Isn't it a bit deceptive?&quot; Jeanine asks. &quot;It feels a bit dishonest to have you interview for one role then change the goalposts afterwards&quot; she adds, empathizing with how she expects Lucas must be feeling. &quot;That's one way to look at it&quot; he replies calmly, &quot;but there is only one outcome that thinking like that can lead to, and less to be gained from it&quot;.</p>
<p>Jeanine's eyes are locked on Lucas, intrigued by his optimistic approach to the situation, and eagerly waiting for his next words. &quot;If long term I will grow more, have more opportunities, and more potential earning power...well a short term <em>easier</em> role would make sense&quot; Lucas suggests. &quot;That's...true. I didn't think about it like that&quot; Jeanine admits. Lucas continues, &quot;...and if what you suggest is true; if the actual team turns out to be as misleading as this interview situation...well I can always move to another team, or another company, and I'll be better off with this experience behind me...more than I will by staying with what I already have.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeanine continues nodding after Lucas finishes, her gaze unbroken as he moves around the kitchen preparing dinner for both of them. &quot;You know, I'm so proud of you Lucas. No matter what decision you make on this, you have already helped yourself fix your situation&quot; Jeanine tells him.</p>
<p>The next morning Lucas meets again with Sheree to go over the questions Lucas has. Most importantly, Lucas confirms the level is lower than his original expectations. Sheree explains &quot;The team really think you're a great fit and want you to join. When they met to discuss feedback, they felt you would be more successful coming in with lower expectations initially, and being on the fast path to promotion&quot;. &quot;I see&quot; Lucas says, &quot;so then I should expect still to do the job of a senior engineer to demonstrate readiness for promotion?&quot;. &quot;Yes - that will be your fast path to promotion&quot; Sheree explains. &quot;I see&quot; Lucas responds, not letting on how this affects his decision.</p>
<p>&quot;So, how does the offer sound...are you ready to become a Bluey?&quot; Sheree playfully asks, referring to the self assigned nickname given to the company's engineers. &quot;Well...&quot; Lucas begins &quot;based on what I know about the role I would be happy to come over if we can top up the RSU allocation to 300&quot;. Sheree's response is delayed. Lucas is confident this is beyond her authority to agree to and is not surprised when he is told she will need to discuss with her team. Lucas thanks her for their conversation and reiterates his readiness to &quot;become a Bluey&quot; before ending the call. &quot;Woo...FIGJAM!&quot; Lucas' exclaims aloud, his fist punching the air and startling Sugar into evacuating the room. A wave of pride rushes over Lucas as Jeanine's words from last night run through his head.</p>
<p>Lucas slides the rocker on his phone to take it off silent. A rare occurrence, but justified in these equally rare circumstances. The anticipation of the phone ringing distracts Lucas through the afternoon as he waits to hear whether his counter offer will be accepted. He finds himself checking the screen multiple times; he has so infrequently heard his phone ring he isn't entirely sure which ringtone is set and whether he would notice if it rang.</p>
<p>The phone does not ring that afternoon however. Nor does it ring the next morning.</p>
<p>Lucas heads to the office to distract himself from the anticipation of Sheree's response. He avoids his phone, keeping the rocker firmly on silent and checking only at lunch when Jeanine usually sends a message. That afternoon as Lucas reviews pull requests from his team he notices an immersive sense of serenity in his work. He leaves encouraging notes of appreciation for the junior engineers on their reviews, and later sends each a &quot;big note&quot; (the company tool for peer recognition) to highlight their growth to those outside his team. As he heads home for the day he reflects on how the interview experience has given him a fresh look at his work and his team. His own growth has led to positive guidance for them and more appreciation for Lucas a leader. </p>
<p>Lucas checks his personal email after breakfast the next morning. Through the newsletters and unwanted emails he finds the reply he has been waiting for. A fresh reply on the original offer email. Lucas quickly opens and reads the brief single line of text:</p>
